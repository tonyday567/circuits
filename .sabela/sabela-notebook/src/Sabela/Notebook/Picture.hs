Module      : Sabela.Notebook.Picture
Description : Build pictures by snapping simple shapes together.

A __picture__ is a drawing made of simple shapes — circles, rectangles, lines,
text — that you combine, colour, and move around. Building a picture never draws
anything; it just /describes/ a drawing. You see it with 'picture'.

= The two ideas

1. __Make shapes__ with 'circle', 'rectangle', 'line', 'polygon', 'text'.
2. __Combine and dress them up__: put one on top of another with @'<>'@ (or
   'group'), recolour with 'fill'\/'stroke', and move with 'translate'\/'scale'\/
   'rotate'.

= A first picture

>>> picture (fill red (circle (150, 150) 60))      -- a red circle, shown in the cell

Stack shapes with @'<>'@ (later ones draw on top):

>>> picture (fill blue (rectangle (50,50) 200 100) <> fill white (circle (150,100) 30))

Move a shape without changing how it was built:

>>> picture (translate (100, 0) (fill green (circle (60, 60) 40)))

= Colours

Use a named colour ('red', 'green', 'blue', 'black', 'white', …) or mix your own
with 'rgb'.

>>> picture (fill (rgb 255 140 0) (circle (150,150) 70))   -- orange

= Coordinates

The canvas is like a sheet of graph paper. @(0, 0)@ is the __top-left__ corner;
@x@ grows to the right and @y@ grows __downward__ (the usual computer-screen
convention). The default canvas is 300×300; use 'pictureOn' for a different size.

(with a margin) and with left\/bottom axes. Great for plotting a running total
from a data stream — e.g. @lineChart defaultCanvas (occurrencesOf (scanlE (+) 0 e))@.
