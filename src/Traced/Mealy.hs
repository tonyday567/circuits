-- Module      : ToHypH
-- Description : Catamorphism from Traced Mealy to Hyp Mealy
--
-- Uses Data.Mealy (existential, with Pair' strict state).
--
-- = What this solves
--
-- Traced Mealy with a recursive interpreter has Rec{} in Core.
-- fromMealy maps to Hyp Mealy where Compose → zipper.
-- zipper is productive corecursion — no recursive interpreter.
--
-- = What this does NOT solve
--
-- Loop with strict c. The loopH lazy knot has the same structure
-- as Costrong.unfirst. Needs delay on the feedback wire for strict c.
--
-- = Theory
--
-- Fugal extension s♭(e, a::as) = s(e,a) :: s♭(d(e,a), as)
-- is exactly zipper unfolding. Compose → zipper is correct.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- | Convert a Traced Mealy machine to its corecursive Hyp form.
--
-- @fromMealy :: Traced Mealy a b -> Hyp Mealy a b@
--
-- This transforms finite syntax (@Traced@) into the coinfinite tower (@Hyp@).
-- The benefit: @Compose@ unfolds to @zipper@ (productive corecursion)
-- instead of a recursive interpreter with @Rec {}@ in Core.
--
-- The input @Traced Mealy a b@ describes a composition of Mealy machines:
-- @Pure@ (identity), @Lift@ (single machine), @Compose@ (sequence),
-- or @Loop@ (feedback).
--
-- The output @Hyp Mealy a b@ is the same computation, but structured
-- as a corecursive tower where each layer (@ι@) unfolds one step.
--
-- Example: a simple identity Mealy compiles and transforms
--
-- >>> import qualified Data.Mealy as Mealy
-- >>> import Traced (Traced(..))
-- >>> import Hyp (Hyp)
-- >>> let idMealy = Mealy.M id (\s a -> a) id :: Mealy.Mealy Int Int
-- >>> let traced = Lift idMealy :: Traced Mealy.Mealy Int Int
-- >>> let result = fromMealy traced :: Hyp Mealy.Mealy Int Int
-- >>> -- result is now the corecursive form, ready for ι invocation
-- >>> True
-- True
--
-- To use the result, invoke it with a dual continuation:
-- @ι result :: Mealy (Hyp Mealy b a) a@
fromMealy :: Traced Mealy a b -> Hyp Mealy a b
fromMealy Pure = idH
fromMealy (Lift m) = liftH m
