-- | A span-shaped Mealy machine: a morphism across a tensored channel.
--
-- @
--   Body t ch arr a b  =  arr (t ch a) (t ch b)
-- @
--
-- Both the channel and the payload enter together, and both exit together.
-- 'Circuit.Moore.MachineP' specializes this shape to a MachineP machine over a
-- polynomial interface; 'Circuit.Process.Process' is the pointed monomial
-- special case of that.
--
-- == Anatomy
--
-- * __@t@ — tensor__: the bifunctor that pairs a channel with a payload.
--   Common choices are @(,)@ for simultaneous sharing, 'Either' for sequential
--   iteration, and 'Data.These.These' for scheduled interleaving.
--
-- * __@ch@ — channel__: the value threaded alongside the payload.  It may be
--   state, residual, a stream, or any other value the base arrow @arr@ carries
--   along with the input and output.
--
-- * __@arr@ — arrow / morphism__: the base category.  Usually @(->)@ or a
--   Kleisli arrow @K m@.  The opposite arrow @Circuit.Category.Op arr@ is also
--   available, so @Body t ch (Op (->)) a b@ is a first-class codata body:
--   the channel carries the residual and the internal morphism runs backward.
--   This makes the @Set^op@ rung of the polynomial equipment explicit.
--
-- This arrangement is the common shape underlying loops, processes, systems,
-- and channel ends: a morphism whose input and output both carry an ambient
-- channel.  'Body' makes that shape explicit before any tracing, scheduling,
-- or pole-splitting is added.

-- | A morphism across a tensored channel.
--
-- The opposite arrow reverses the internal morphism while keeping the channel
-- threading intact:
--
-- >>> let b = Body (Op (\(s, a) -> (s, a + 1))) :: Body (,) Int (Op (->)) Int Int
-- >>> runOp (morphism b) (5, 3)
-- (5,4)
--
-- @Body t ch arr a b@ is a morphism @arr (t ch a) (t ch b)@.  The channel
-- @ch@ is threaded alongside the payload by the tensor @t@; it may be state,
-- residual, a stream, or any other value the base arrow @arr@ carries along
-- with the input and output.  Composition threads the same channel through
-- both morphisms.

-- | Run an 'Either' body as a partial function @a -> b@ with a fuel bound.
-- Execution starts with the external input @a@; if the body emits a label
-- @ch@ the runner feeds @Left ch@ back in, decrementing the fuel.
--
-- Returns the result (if any) and the number of steps taken.  A flowchart has
-- no stored state — the input is the entire initial configuration — so there
-- is no seed parameter.  This is the coproduct analogue of the cartesian
-- runner: where @(,)@ bodies run as stream functions, 'Either' bodies run as
-- halting computations.
