-- Module      : Traced
-- Description : Free traced monoidal category over any base category
--
-- @Traced arr a b@ is the free traced monoidal category built over
-- any base category @arr@.
--
-- Four constructors:
--
-- * 'Pure'    — identity
-- * 'Lift'    — lift a base morphism @arr a b@ into syntax
-- * 'Compose' — sequential composition
-- * 'Loop'    — feedback (existentially quantified state)
--
-- The key equation: @loop = Loop@ (ArrowLoop instance)
--
-- Instantiations:
--
-- @
-- Traced (->) a b   -- over Haskell functions    (the workhorse)
-- Traced (↬)  a b   -- over hyperfunctions        (yes, this is real)
-- Traced Mealy a b  -- over Mealy machines         (explicit sequential state)
-- @
--
-- Interpreter:
--
-- @
-- run :: (Category arr, ArrowLoop arr) => Traced arr a b -> arr a b
-- @
--
-- Swapping @arr@ gives a different compiler for the same syntax tree.
-- This is the Lawvere architecture: syntax is @Traced arr@,
-- semantics is @arr@, @run@ is the evaluation functor.
--
-- Key finding:
-- Finally Tagless puts protocol in types (erased at runtime, inaccessible).
-- Initially Tagged puts protocol in values (present at runtime, inspectable).
-- Don't give your values to types.

-- by parametricity.

-- Running: general Category + ArrowLoop

-- | Interpret @Traced arr@ into @arr@.
--
-- Implements the sliding law: when Knot appears on the left of Compose,
-- it slides through and absorbs the right side. This requires pattern
-- matching on the left argument to detect Knot and reassociate Compose.
--
-- The naive @interpret g . interpret h@ is incorrect because it does not implement
-- the sliding transformation: knots must be able to absorb compositions.
--
-- The sliding law: feedback variables slide left through Compose chains,
-- absorbing the right side via the Costrong structure. The Knot constructor
-- is the profunctor operation Costrong.unfirst, and the sliding works by
-- lifting the right morphism to work on the feedback pair via @first@.
--
-- Each constructor dispatches to the corresponding @arr@ operation:
--
-- @
-- Pure     →  id
-- Lift f   →  f
-- Compose  →  pattern match on left to handle sliding
-- Knot p   →  loop (interpret p)

-- | Evaluate @Traced (->)@ to a Haskell function.
--
-- Handles two structural laws definitionally:
--
-- 1. Associativity — left-nested @Compose@ is reassociated right.
-- 2. Sliding      — @Loop@ on the left of @Compose@ absorbs the right.
--
-- Example: Simple composition
--
-- >>> let f = Compose (Lift (+ 1)) (Lift (* 2))
-- >>> run f 5
-- 11
--
-- Example: Knot and fixed point (feedback loop)
--
-- See @test-traced-fn-simple.hs@ for integration tests of Knot behavior
-- with identity and fixed-point functions. The core pattern:
-- Knot absorbs the feedback wire via Mendler normalisation.

-- * Examples

-- $knot-tying
-- = Knot-Tying with Loop
--
-- A @Loop@ ties a knot: the feedback channel carries a value that depends on itself.
-- Haskell's laziness makes this productive.
--
-- Example: Fibonacci sequence via corecursion.
--
-- @
-- fib idx = run $ Knot $ Lift $ \\(i, fibs) -> 
--           (fibs !! i, 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (drop 1 fibs))
-- @
--
-- The knot: @fibs@ is both the input and the infinite sequence generated from itself.
-- The knot is tied in the pattern match: the second component of the output
-- becomes the input for the next iteration, creating recursive self-reference.
--
-- Computing Fibonacci values:
--
-- >>> (run $ Knot $ Lift $ \(i, fibs) -> (fibs !! i, 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (drop 1 fibs))) 10
